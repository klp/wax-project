Connie Cordon graduated in 2018 from Pratt Institute with a BFA in Communication Design with a concentration in Illustration. Publications and exhibitions include 3×3 Illustration Annual No. 16, Creative Quarterly 55, Society of Illustrators 2019, Society of Illustrators 2018, and Melted City 4 at YUI Gallery in 2018.

Her main interests include collaging, which later turned into an interest in archives, as she spent most of her time researching materials through physical and digital ones. She became interested in humanities while working on her illustration thesis, in which she created a series of images based on other individuals’ personal recounts of sexual trauma they experienced during childhood. By researching how trauma can impact an individual’s memory, she also explored the media’s interpretation of similar topics about abuse and sexuality, and how it can be misconstrued into something else entirely. For example, how the media has managed to make Lolita a positive cultural icon in our society despite the controversy the book caused. This research led her to questions about the notions of censorship and truth, censorship in advertising, and more specifically the ethics and morals regarding censorship in art and photography.

She is eager to explore how humanities and social sciences are intertwined with visual media in regards to storytelling, as well as the moral responsibility that visual storytellers have in regards to its impact on culture. She hopes to gain the tools needed in order to practice multidisciplinary experimentation with emerging media technologies that deal critically and logically with subjective, complex, and imperfect information.  

Her main contributions to the project is researching material, creating a visual identity, outreach and social media, as well as project management in conjunction with Kai.

Kai Prenger graduated from Reed College in 2004 earning a BA in Literature, writing and defending a thesis called The Same But Different, an experiment applying the post-colonial theories of Homi K. Bhabha to 19th century American literature. His academic interests include misuse tools and theoretical frameworks on unexpected topics, using arbitrary process to transform subject matter (deformance)  and exploring areas deemed boring by a plurality of scholars. Previous work for pay includes dry cleaning, construction, social work, financial operations, product management, and data analysis and engineering. As a graduate student, he pursues play as productive strategy in scholarship. His main contributions to the project include development, theoretical and educational context, and shares project management duties with Connie, the co-project leader.
